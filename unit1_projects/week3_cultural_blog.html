		<p>It was a great experience to be able to pair with others to solve challenges. The two things I really enjoy about pair programming are 1) it keeps my mind open and fresh, and helps me think in different ways since I can see how others solve problems, and 2) it helps immensely during 'road block' moments. When there's someone else there to help talk you through a problem, 'road blocks' are much less frequent and even when 'road blocks' are hit, they tend to get solved much quicker than on your own.</p>

		<p> One frustrating, yet rewarding, part of paired programming is that you need to make sure you are being <b> very </b> clear when communicating with your peer. This can be frustrating because you may know exactly what you want to do in your head but you may have a hard time explaining it perfectly. However, this is also extremely rewarding because it teaches you how to accurately communicate your goals and ideas while programming, which is essential to writing good code and working with others.</p>

		<p> I checked Socrates and still do not see any feedback that has been left for me; however, I can see that others have rated the feedback I left for others. It feels good to know that others thought my feedback was Specific, Actionable, and Kind.</p>

		<p> I liked the process of writing feedback because it helped me to reflect on the peer programming session and think about ways I could improve in the future. I think the most difficult part of writing fedback is giving criticism, because I don't want to offend others. To make sure I'm not being offensive and that I'm being helpful, I try to consciously make sure that my feedback is specific, actionable, and kind. Overall, I really like pairing and I think receiving feedback will help me to focus on my weaknesses and how I can improve them.</p>
