				<p> Classes are used for instances where you need to create a 'template' of sorts that you will need to re-use. For example, in the image above, I sized and formatted all the logos at the bottom of the page using a class. Since I wanted all of the logos to be the same height regardless of the original image size, I created a class called .logoimage to equally size them all.</p>

				<img src= "images/logoimage.png" alt= "logo image" class = "picture">

				<p> This way, I dont have to re-type the dimensions each time I add a new logo. Instead, I just make sure I assign the class .logoimage to any logo I want to add. Simple!</p>

				<h3> <center>IDs</center></h3>

				<p> IDs, on the other hand, should be used when you need to do something unique on your page that will not need to be re-used. For instance, in the original image at the top of the page, the formatting for the banner image at the top (the nature photo) is unique; since I'll only have one banner image on my site and it needs to be styled a certain way, I used an ID. In my instance, I named the ID #bannerphoto.</p>

				<img src= "images/bannerphoto.png" alt= "banner photo" class = "picture">

				<p> And those are the basics of Classes vs. IDs. Hope this helps! </p>
