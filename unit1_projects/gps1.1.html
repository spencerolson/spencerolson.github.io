        <p><b>Peer programming:</b> Pair programming is an agile software
        development technique in which two programmers
        work together at one workstation. It is 
        comprised of a Driver and Navigator.

    <p><b>Why is peer programming important?</b><br>
        On demand, the two programmers can brainstorm any challenging problem. Because the two programmers periodically switch roles, they work together as equals to develop software. This practice of pair programming can be integrated into any software development process. As an example, this paper describes the changes that were made to the Personal Software Process (PSP) to leverage the power of two programmers working together, thereby formulating the Collaborative Software Process (CSP).

            Pairing for the first time was an interesting and unique experience. It was an ejoyable experience becase we were able to build off of each other and use eachother as a resource when we hit snags. We both found value out of both positions and found it useful to switch roles part way through the GPS. The driver/navigator model worked well for us, because we were able to draw upon our combined strengths and work towards a common goal. We both attempted to edit the file at the same time, which did not work, further solidifying the importance of the separate roles.
