		<p>JavaScript is undeniably one of the most popular languages when it comes to web development. But why, one might ask? What makes JavaScript more popular than any other language out there? The answer lies in JavaScript's 3 major strengths: <b> Ease of Use </b>, <b> Browser Support </b>, and <b> Client and Server Side Functionality</b>.</p>

		<p> <h2> Ease of Use </h2> </p>
		<p> JavaSript is easy to use; you don't need a server or a virtual machine. Instead, you add JavaScript to a web page, reload the browser, and you're good to go. In addition, JavaScript has an object-oriented architecture, similar to Java and C++. </p>
		

		<p> <h2> Browser Support </h2> </p>
		<p> The second reason JavaScript is so popular is due to browser support. Whether you're using Chrome, Safari, or Internet Explorer, JavaScript is supported. This means users get the same experience regardless of their browser choice. Good stuff!</p>

		<p> <h2> Client and Server Side Functionality </h2> </p>
		<p> The third and final reason JavaScript is so popular is due to its client and server side functionality. Using JavaScript, we can program the behavior of a browser; this is called client-side scripting. Secondly, we can use JavaScript to program the behavior of a server; this is called server-side scripting. Since we can deal with both client-side and server-side scripting using the same language, it's easy to see why JavaSript is a popular choice.</p>
