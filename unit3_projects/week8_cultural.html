			<p>  I really enjoyed this weeks cultural blog topic. Watching Shereef's Fireside Chat video was definitely eye-opening yet comforting at the same time. After watching the video, I feel uneasy and scared about being in a 'kitchen' environment, but at the same time it's that environment that excites me. I'm worried I'll slip into the 'restaurant' mentality, but I know if I'm able to feel comfortable showing my ignorances and being in the figure-it-out 'kitchen' mentality that I'll do well. I'm scared that I'm only going to get out of this program what I put into it, but I'm also feeling empowered for the same reason. My entire experience is going to be driven by my mentality, my willingness to be an adventurer, and my refusal to sit and be spoon-fed education. This is drastically different from my college experience, but that's why I'm going with DBC instead of getting a masters!</p>

			<p> Watching this video of Shereef inspires me, and makes me want to share the same passion, excitement, and empathy that he has. I've quit my job, I've dished out considerable cash for this program, and I'm really putting a lot on the line. But I'm comforted by the fact that I'm not alone -- I'm joined by 20 other crazy-ass people that are doing the exact same thing! I'm excited to create this experience with the rest of the cohort, and to work as a team to become world-class beginner developers. I think I'll fit in well at DBC, because I'm always doing my best to make sure I'm helping those around me, and I genuinely want the best for my peers. I'm not here to outperform others; I'm here to learn from others and also to show them what skills I know. I've already met a few follks from this cohort and it's clear they have the same mentality. We're all in this together and it's going to be a crazy ride. Here we go!</p>
