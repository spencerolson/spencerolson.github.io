			<h3> <center>What was it about? What happened? What was the source of the conflict?</center></h3>
			<p> A couple years ago, when I was living at home, my parents were out of town and I decided to have some friends over for a fiesta. We all had a blast, enjoyed the night, and a few of my friends crashed on the couch for the night. </p>

			<p> The next morning/afternoon, everyone starting waking up and making their way home. My then girlfriend offered to drive my friend Craig home, and he accepted. They headed off, and I began cleaning the house up. About 10 minutes later, I received a call from my girlfriend and she asked me if the couch looked alright. I checked the couch and nothing looked out of order. "Yeah, it looks fine", i told her. "Why do you ask?". She then proceeded to tell me that she had noticed when dropping off Craig that he had had a large brown stain on the back of his shirt. Interesting. </p>

			<p>Craig had crashed on the couch, so if his shirt had a fresh brown stain on it, then surely the couch would too, right? So I checked the couch again, but this time I was more thorough in my search. If the brown stain was not immediately visible on the couch, then maybe, just maybe, this was a cover-up. I decided to flip the couch cushions to see if my good ol' pal Craig had been up to some foul play. Sure enough, the second couch cushion I flipped over was <b> covered </b> in a mysterious brown stain. </p>

			<p> The stain did not smell horrible (in fact it smelled pretty good), so at least I could be sure the worst of my fears had not been realized: Craig had not defecated on my couch. Good. Next, I
			found a second, and very important, piece of evidence: an empty Butterfinger BB box. It was all coming together. Craig had drank one too many King Cobras the night before, attempted to dump an entire box of Butterfinger BBs into his mouth while laying on my couch, and then he fell asleep. As he rolled around during his sleep throughout the night, the weight of his body had smashed the Butterfinger BBs into a chocolate paste that covered his shirt and my couch cushion. In the morning, he flipped the cushion and peaced out. Thanks Craig. </p>

			<h3> <center>How did you handle that conflict?</center></h3>
				<p> Once I had solved the case, I needed some time to calm down. I was very angry and couldn't believe that he would try to pull something like that, instead of being honest and telling me what had happened. I gave myself 30 minutes to calm down before taking any further action.</p>
				
				<p> My natural reaction to conflict is to avoid it at all costs, and to bottle things up instead of being vocal about my anger. I knew this was not a good plan, and that I couldn't let myself bottle up the anger, so I gave Craig a call and asked him to explain why he had committed this chocolatey crime. I did my best to keep my composure and explain why I was feeling upset. </p>

				<h3> <center>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</center></h3>
				<p> My actions definitely made the conflict better. As opposed to letting my anger get bottled up, I was able to communicate to Craig why I was upset with him and I was also able to get his side of the story (although he didn't have much of a story to back up his actions). I felt better after calling Craig and talking to him, and was proud of myself for not bottling up the anger.</p>

				<h3> <center>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</center></h3>
				<p> If I could go back, I might ask Craig if there was a specific reason he did not feel comfortable telling me what happened. Maybe I came off as unapproachable to him, or there was some other reason he wanted to cover up his heinous crime. If I had known what made me unapproachable, I might have been able to change my attitude or demeanor.</p>

				<h3> <center>What did you learn from this experience?</center></h3>
				<p> From this experience, I honestly think the biggest thing I learned is that people just do stupid things every once in a while. Things that are outside of their normal character. Craig is a good friend of mine and I wouldn't let this Butterfinger BB massacre destroy our friendship. Sometimes you just have to let things go, forgive others, and carry on.<p>
